### What is Data Quality and How Do You Measure It for Best Results?
Some Data Quality Metrics are:
- Completeness
- Uniqueness
- Timeliness (How much of an impact does date and time have on the data? This could be previous sales, product launches or any information that is relied on over a period of time to be accurate.)
- Validity (Does the data conform to the respective standards set for it?)
- Accuracy (How well does the data reflect the real-world person or thing that is identified by it?)
- Consistency (How well does the data align with a preconceived pattern? Birth dates share a common consistency issue, since in the U.S., the standard is MM/DD/YYYY, whereas in Europe and other areas, the usage of DD/MM/YYYY is standard.)
